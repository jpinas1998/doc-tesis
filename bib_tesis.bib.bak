  comment   = {Online environments offer rich potential for studying how
individuals choose teammates for a goal-oriented activity. Our
results provide evidence consistent with the factors identified
by Hinds et al. [10] as important in team formation: familiarity,
homophily, and competence. We find that the more often two
players play together, the more likely it is that they are playing
on the same (large) team and even on the same (smaller)
squad within that team. We presume that this effect occurs
in part because pairs that had success in previous interactions
continue to select one another as partners while those that
failed in previous interactions differentially drop out of future
association. A more fine grained dynamic examination of
partner choice that would condition on previous game outcome
is needed to substantiate this interpretation.
Homophily as a factor clearly shows up with respect to country. To be fair, this fact could be due simply to a time/distance difference between players in different countries
serving as a disincentive to play together at the same time on a
server in one or another’s country, especially considering that
distance can heavily affect latency. Nevertheless, the extent to which interactions between those in the same country exceed
chance expectations is quite large, and not just for dyadic
teammate relations but also when we examine the composition
of squads of different sizes. Homophily also occurs with
respect to skill level. Our results make it clear that teammates
and squad mates are far more likely to be close to each other
in skill than could be expected by chance.
Finally, it is also clear that competence is a driver for
interaction, but the connection is complex. First, we found that
the most frequent pair interactions occur between players on
the same squad with relatively high rank (i.e., very competent
players). Likewise, pairs that are on average less competent
have less frequent interaction. Second, we saw a similar story
with respect to the absolute difference in rank between the
pairs. I.e., players that were of approximately the same rank
were increasingly likely to have more interactions together},

  comment = {-cita muchos ejemplos de formación de equipos.

-el artículo se centra principalmente en la falla de los equipos (faultline). Tiene como obejtivo minimizar a la hora de conformar el equipo la falla entre sus miembros.

se muestra un estado del arte en el estudio de team-faultlines, poniendo en cada caso las distintas solucions. Explicando que la mayoría tienen un costo computacional muy alto. Se centran en la solución con: verage Silhouette Width (ASW), que mide dado un equipo el faultline, o seam que no foma equipos con esta técnica pero la utilizan para ello.

Our work is the first to incorporate the faultline concept into an algorithmic framework for utomated team-formation. From a team-builder’s perspective, the ability to control the faultlines of
teams that are automatically sampled from a large population of candidates has multiple uses. First, it allows the team builder to proactively reduce the risk of undesirable outcomes that have been consistently linked with faultlines, such as conflicts, polarization, and disintegration. Second, it provides an effective way to manage the diversity within a team. A trivial way to eliminate faultlines is to create highly homogeneous teams. However, this approach would also lead to teams that are unable to benefit from the well-documented benefits of diversity, such as innovation and
increased performance (Kearney, Gebert, & Voelpel, 2009; Roberge & Van Dick, 2010; Van der Vegt & Janssen, 2003). In order to avoid such shortcomings, a team-builder can utilize our algorithmic framework to strategically engineer low-faultline teams without over-penalizing diversity. A characteristic example is a team that is maximally diverse; a team in which no two individuals share a common attribute. Consistent with the faultline theory by Lau and Murnighan (1998), our framework would recognize this as a team with the same faultline potential as a perfectly homogeneous team. We demonstrate this via examples in Figs. 1 and 2. Our team-partitioning paradigm has applications in both an organizational and educational setting. In a firm setting, the task of partitioning a workforce into teams is common. By using the proposed FaultlineSplitter algorithm, a manager can identify faultline-minimizing partitionings within the multidimensional space defined by various employee features. A regression analysis, such as the one we described in Section 5.3.2, can guide the manager’s team-building efforts by selecting specific features with potentially problematic faultlines. In a classroom setting, instructors often face the task of partitioning their students into teams for assignments and projects. As we demonstrated in our experiments, faultlines in student teams can have a strong association with meaningful outcomes, such as performance and member satisfaction. By releasing our team-partitioning software, we hope that we can automate this team-formation task and benefit both students  and instructors.},

  comment = {The emphasis of this work is to analyse and assess
a cohort of students’ perspectives on team learning practices
in activity-based learning approach. This activity was
implemented in Linear Control Systems course. The
motivation for this work is the authors’ experience in
teaching the course in previous iteration. It was observed that
some teams performed exceedingly well, and a few others
struggled to complete the activity. We believe that the reason
for this was that the team formation was random. Team
learning emphasizes interaction between students ‘through
peer-to-peer learning, which strengthens the ability of a
student to solve problems better. The authors felt there is an
opportunity to explore the following research question: Does
working in teams formed with mixed learning styles enhance
student learning? In order to form teams, students underwent
Index of Learning Styles Questionnaire by Richard M.
Felder and Barbara A. Soloman. A common problem
statement on modified Load-Frequency control model of an
isolated power system area, to be operated with a controller
was given student teams. Section-A comprised of 16 teams
and Section-B had 13 teams, each team involving members
with different learning styles. A pre-test and post-test were
conducted to know the change in conceptual understanding.
The post-test results indicate improvement in conceptual
understanding. This is also validated by the ANOVA test
with a 5% level of significance. From this study, it is
observed that, strategic team formation is considered as a
favourable approach for augmenting students’ learning.},

  comment = {For the first question, our review illustrates four primary mechanisms of team formation via partner recruitment:
competence, homophily, familiarity, and affect. The perception of competence is a mechanism of team formation that
is people use to recruit teammates for a group task. Studies show that people use diffuse status characteristics and
reputational information as social cues to indicate competence (Hinds et al., 2000; Skvoretz & Bailey, 2016).
Homophily is another mechanism of team formation. Scholars note that homophilous ties in self‐organized work
groups show that the perception of similarity due to a shared social identity influences the selection of team members
(Ruef et al., 2003).
The third mechanism of team formation is familiarity. Research suggests that individuals are more likely to form a
team with people whom they already know, than with strangers (Bercovitz & Feldman, 2011; Hinds et al., 2000).
Lastly, affect is the fourth mechanism of team formation. Studies on affect illustrates that supportive and
unsupportive sentiments about potential teammates strongly influence team member selection patterns (Casciaro &
Lobo, 2008; Lynn et al., 2016). In sum, all four mechanisms attend to both the individual attributes (e.g. status
characteristics) and the relational aspects (e.g. choice associations) relevant to actors’ decision‐making behaviors.},
